# Halomonas-TD01-GEM

- Brief Repository Description

This repository contains a genome-scale metabolic model **Halo** for a salt-tolerant bacteria _Halomonas bluephagenesis_ TD01.

- Abstract:
The halophile _Halomonas bluephagenesis_ TD01 and its derivatives have been successfully developed as a low-cost platform for the unsterile and continuous production of chemicals. Here we present the de novo reconstruction of its GEM. Two draft models from E. coli GEM iJO1366 (by cobrapy) and MetaCyc (by RAVEN 2.0) were firstly generated and then combined. The core-biomass equation from iJO1366
was used. Gap-filling was performed with iJO1366 as universal model.

- Model KeyWords:

**GEM Category:** Species; **Utilisation:** Predictive simulation; **Field:** Metabolic-network reconstruction; **Type of Model:** Reconstruction; **Taxonomy:** _Halomonas bluephagenesis_; **Metabolic System:** General Metabolism; **Strain:** TD01; **Condition:** Defined medium;
